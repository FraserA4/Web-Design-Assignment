PERSONAL

I enjoy playing computer games, skiing, baking and also traveling. Sociable and friendly, I have a sense of humour, and take instruction well. I’m responsible for managing my own expenses for clothing, haircuts, takeaways and socialising. I bought my own ticket for the Kendrick Lamar concert and am getting better at saving money. I am going to be starting a course for Digital and Social Media in 2022
